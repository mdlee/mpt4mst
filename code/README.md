The `trinity` package is required: https://github.com/joachimvandekerckhove/trinity

The code uses
- `Raxes.m` for creating separated axes like R graphics often uses
- `pantoneColors.mat` which provides a palette of colors (shown in `pantoneColors.png`)
- `setFigure.m` for setting the figure window, allowing for changing single and dual monitor setup
